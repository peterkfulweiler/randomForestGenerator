Final Project For Machine Learning Spring 2022
ID3 Random Forest Algorithm and Random Perceptron Generator.

For this project, we decided to submit two different sets of files due to difficulties compiling and time constraints.

To run the Random Perceptron Algorithm, please read the following instructions:

Notes:
- The code for this algorithm is stored in *insert files here*


- To run the random perceptron forest for the different datasets, simply just go into the notebook and run the separate cells.
The first cell is the perceptron forest for the BankNote Authentication.
The second cell is the perceptron forest of the Sonar dataset.

Each run of the random perceptron forest prints the Training and testing accuracy for a single perceptron
the testing and training accuracy for the optimized

To run the ID3 Random Forest Algorithm, please read the following instructions:

Notes:
- the algorithm and the training/testing results can be
found in the file called COMP343_Final_Project_ID3_Random_Forest.ipynb
- The data sets we used were the same

1. First, upload the sonar data set and banknotes data set
2. Run the entire code on google colab
3. Code block 7 onwards has code to get the test and train accuracies of the model
4. For each model, it will print the train and test accuracies as well as the
the best depth from get_hyperparameters. After that, it will print the average test and train
accuracies of the models for the ID3 Random Forest Algorithm. Then, it will print the
test and train accuracy of the ID3 algorithm we did in class for both data sets.

The order of the models is as follows:
1. Sonar Bin Strategy 1 (Random Forest)
2. Sonar Bin Strategy 2 (Random Forest)
3. Sonar Bin Strategy 1 and 2 (ID3 from class)
4. Banknotes Bin Strategy 1 (Random Forest)
5. Banknotes Bin Strategy 2 (Random Forest)
6. Banknotes Bin Strategy 1 and 2 (ID3 from class)
