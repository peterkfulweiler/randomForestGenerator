# randomForestGenerator
Final Project For Machine Learning Spring 2022

- To run the random perceptron forest for the different datasets, simply just go into the notebook and run the separate cells.
The first cell is the perceptron forest for the BankNote Aunthenitication.
The second cell is the perceptron forest of the Sonar dataset.

Each run of the random perceptron forest prints the Training and testing accuracy for a single perceptron 
the testing and training accuracy for the optimized
